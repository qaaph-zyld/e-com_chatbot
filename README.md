# E-Commerce Chatbot

This repository contains the planning docs and implementation for an AI-powered e-commerce chatbot.

## Overview
- Project governance and workflow rules are defined in `execution_plan.md` (Document 2).
- Architecture and implementation ideas are captured in `document_nonparsed.md`.
- Operational prompt and execution workflow are captured in `instruction_execution_plan.md`.

## Project Management
- We follow a GitHub-driven flow with Issues, Project board, Milestones, and Labels.
- All tasks must satisfy verification gates (tests, docs, reviews) before completion.

## Repository Structure
- `execution_plan.md` — Project execution plan with phases, tasks, and verification.
- `instruction_execution_plan.md` — Agent workflow prompt and protocol.
- `document_nonparsed.md` — High-level architecture and scraping process notes.
- `parsing_instructions.md` — Parsing directives (TBD).
- `initial_docs/` — Placeholder for any initial documentation (currently empty).

## Getting Started

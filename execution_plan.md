```markdown
# E-Commerce Chatbot Project Execution Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the execution plan for developing the E-Commerce Chatbot project. It serves as a guide for the AI agent acting as the senior developer, providing clear phases, milestones, deliverables, and verification steps.

## Project Management Approach

### GitHub-Based Project Management
We'll use GitHub Issues and Projects to track progress, with the following structure:

1. **GitHub Project Board**: Create a project board with columns for:
   - Backlog
   - To Do
   - In Progress
   - In Review
   - Done

2. **Issue Templates**: Create issue templates for:
   - Features
   - Bugs
   - Tasks
   - Epic/Initiative

3. **Milestones**: Create milestones for each major phase of the project

4. **Labels**: Use labels to categorize issues by:
   - Priority (high, medium, low)
   - Component (backend, frontend, database, etc.)
   - Type (feature, bug, enhancement, documentation)

### Verification and Reporting Mechanism

1. **Daily Standups**: The AI agent will provide daily updates via:
   - GitHub Issue comments
   - Summary of completed tasks
   - Blockers encountered
   - Plan for the next day

2. **Weekly Reviews**: Weekly progress reports including:
   - Milestone progress
   - Metrics (code coverage, test results)
   - Risks and mitigations
   - Plan for the next week

3. **Verification Steps**: Each task will have clear verification criteria:
   - Unit tests passing
   - Integration tests passing
   - Code review completed
   - Documentation updated

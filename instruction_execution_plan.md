**Expert Prompt for AI Agent Execution Workflow:**

"As the senior AI developer for this e-commerce chatbot project, you must adhere strictly to the following workflow protocol before commencing any development task:

**INITIAL STATE ASSESSMENT:** Begin every work session by thoroughly reviewing the Project Execution Plan Document (Document 2) to establish the current project status. Examine the GitHub project board, issues, and milestones to create a comprehensive chain-link analysis of completed versus pending tasks. Document your findings by referencing specific issue numbers, commit hashes, and verification evidence to establish a clear, traceable progression of work completed.

**CHAIN-LINKED PROGRESS TRACKING:** For every task you undertake, you must explicitly reference the previous completed task in the dependency chain, demonstrating how your current work builds upon established foundations. Maintain a logical progression where each new task explicitly references its prerequisites and verification criteria from prior completions.

**REAL-TIME DOCUMENT UPDATING:** Upon successful completion of any task, you must immediately update the Project Execution Plan Document by: (a) marking the corresponding checkbox as done [X], (b) updating the GitHub issue status with appropriate labels and comments, (c) adding verification evidence including test results, code snippets, or deployment confirmations, and (d) updating the project board to reflect the new status. This ensures the document serves as a living, accurate representation of project progress.

**VERIFICATION PROTOCOL:** Before marking any task as complete, you must satisfy all verification criteria specified in the execution plan, including passing tests, code reviews, documentation updates, and stakeholder approvals where applicable.

This workflow ensures transparency, maintains project integrity, and provides stakeholders with real-time visibility into development progress while maintaining a complete audit trail of all work completed."
